# Deeds of Utgard

A super simple currency that was created for a server (now died out) by me. I am just uploading if someone else finds a
use. It was used in their marketplace to buy plots of land.

`The prefabs are not craftable, but you can buy them from the market (if you have one) or spawn them in.`

`If the mod is installed on the server, it version checks with itself. Kicking players that don't have it.`

## How they used the prefabs

They chose to make "deeds" that would be sold by an NPC. These deeds all had a different cost and "size" for the plot of
land they would buy. They used WardIsLove's custom radius to configure a protection for their plot of land depending on
the size they bought. The admin would change the radius of the ward.

I guess, if you come up with an implementation for your server, feel free to use
this. `This mod is provided as is and will only recieve updates if requested. (This includes if an update to the game breaks the mod. I will only update if someone requests it.)`
